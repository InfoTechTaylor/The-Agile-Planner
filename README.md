# The-Agile-Planner
The “Agile Planner” will be a python web app to assist users in storing recipes and planning out what to eat each week. Users will be able to add recipes to their recipe box by specifying ingredients, instructions, and supporting meta-data such nutritional info. The user will be able to add recipe cards from their recipe box into a weekly calendar layout for each meal time (breakfast, lunch and dinner). As part of the meal planning process, a user will have the option to add ingredients to a shopping list. A core part of the application will be nutritional value and having a user plan with their nutrition and diet goals in mind. The daily and weekly meal plan will summarize the total calories in addition to other nutritional facts in a running tally. Users can set personal goals for total calories for the day and percentage of each macronutrient so the app can assist in alerting the user when they hit or pass their target.

## Running the App
Within the app package, run program.py to start the app.
