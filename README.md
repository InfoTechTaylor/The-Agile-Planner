# The-Agile-Planner
A meal planning app inspired off of agile scrum planning in the JIRA issue management application. In this case it will be agile meal planning, rather than agile sprint planning, and in place of issues in a backlog there will be recipe cards in a recipe box. The “Agile Planner” will be a python app to assist users in storing recipes and planning out what to eat each week. Users will be able to add recipes to their recipe box by specifying ingredients, instructions, and supporting meta-data such as prep-time and serving size. Then, the main use case for the app, the user will be able to drag recipe cards from their recipe box into a week calendar layout for each meal time (this will start as command line app, and then move to GUI). Once the planning is complete, the user will be able to indicate planning is complete and the app will generate a grocery shopping list based off of the ingredients listed in each recipe added to the plan.
