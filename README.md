# The-Agile-Planner
The “Agile Planner” will be a python mobile and desktop app (starting as a command line interface on the desktop) to assist users in storing recipes and planning out what to eat each week. Users will be able to add recipes to their recipe box by specifying ingredients, instructions, and supporting meta-data such as prep-time and serving size. Then, the main use case for the app, the user will be able to drag recipe cards from their recipe box into a week calendar layout for each meal time (this will start as command line app, and then move to GUI using Kivy). Once the planning is complete, the user will be able to indicate planning is complete and the app will generate a grocery shopping list based off of the ingredients listed in each recipe added to the plan. Potential feature enhancements will include having the concept of a pantry where a user can add items that they have in their pantry so that the planner can more intelligently recommend recipes and create the shopping list. Additionally, adding nutritional meta-data to each recipe will allow for factoring in macro-nutrients into a meal planning session for healthier meals.
